# BostonSnowbot

A Twitter bot that tells you the forecast for Boston, but more importantly tells you when that forecast changes.
It uses the lovely [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev).

It's basically a more push than pull version of my existing habit of checking the forecast every few hours in the winter months.
